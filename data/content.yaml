Profile: I'm a back-end developer with 2 years of experience in writing and developing Go servers. I have also worked on front end technologies, specializing in VueJS. Currently, I'm employed at MKCL, employing their Smart University Framework (SUF). I'm interested in solving complex problems and learning new technologies. Outside of work, I keep myself updated with F1/chess. I enjoy playing computer games and watching 8 out of 10 cats does countdown.
